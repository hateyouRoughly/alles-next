Poor quality and workmanship. Rough edges, puckered seams, massively too big. Also sent later than agreed. Service was terrible. Offered to refund in full if dress was shipped back. Agreed to do this and then some weeks later the seller changed their mind and said they would only refund half and I could keep the dress. When I replied that I would prefer a full refund they they responded by saying it was months after I ordered and what did I expect. Unacceptable.

While Anam provided initial guidance, the dress differed from the images and didn&#39;t fit as hoped. \n\nNavigating the return and refund process was a bit challenging due to the 14-day return policy. The request for a 5-star review to process the refund was unexpected.\n\nSpending $250+, including shipping and customs, made the experience more stressful. It&#39;s worth nothing the dress wasn&#39;t accepted on delivery despite multiple attempts.\n\nIn hindsight, I discovered similar dresses on other sites at lower prices. My advice to potential buyers is to research thoroughly before purchase.

I continued to ask for a refund, and she would not give it to me. I tried returning it, but shipping costs to India is $300 USD.
